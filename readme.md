# Chat-UI

A React/TypeScript interface for chatting with any OpenAI compatible endpoint.

## **Note:**

- Attachments are in beta for OpenAi.  RAG functionality isnt currently possible. I have wired it up to have attachments so we can add this in the future.
- Added a voice icon for ability to send voice commands.  This is curerntly possible with openAI but isnt enabled here.
